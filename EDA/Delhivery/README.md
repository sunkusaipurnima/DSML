Delhivery_feature_engineering
For the Delhivery project, here's a summary in bullet points across two pages:

Project Context:

Goal: Enhance efficiency, quality, and profitability in logistics operations through data intelligence.
Dataset: delhivery_data.csv with trip details, route information, timing, and distance metrics.
Data Handling and Preparation:

Performed data cleaning and sanitization to extract useful features from raw fields.
Aggregated data by combining rows related to single package deliveries, using groupby and aggregation functions like sum() and cumsum().
Feature Engineering and Data Exploration:

Extracted features from destination and source names, and trip creation time.
Calculated delivery durations and compared various time and distance metrics.
Conducted hypothesis testing and visual analysis to understand the relationship between actual and estimated delivery metrics.
In-depth Analysis:

Identified and treated outliers using IQR method.
Normalized and standardized numerical fields.
Utilized one-hot encoding for categorical variables such as route type.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed data structure, detected missing values, and summarized data statistics.
Used distribution plots and boxplots for visual analysis of continuous and categorical variables, respectively.
Offered insights on attribute ranges, distributions, and variable relationships.
Insights and Business Recommendations:

Identified patterns such as high-demand states or corridors, average distances, and delivery times.
Recommended focusing on optimizing busy corridors for improved efficiency and reduced delivery times.
Evaluation and Insights:

Defined clear problem statement and conducted comprehensive EDA.
Created and aggregated features effectively, offering insights into logistics operations.
Addressed missing values and outliers, ensuring data quality for model building.
Analyzed relationships between aggregated fields to uncover efficiency and profitability levers.
Conclusion:

The project delivers actionable insights to optimize logistics operations, focusing on high-demand areas and efficiency improvements.
Suggested data-driven strategies for Delhivery to maintain its lead in the logistics sector by leveraging advanced data analysis and feature engineering techniques.
