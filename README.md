### 5. Yulu : Hypothesis Testing
- **Description:** Yulu is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, which offers unique vehicles for the daily commute. Starting off as a mission to eliminate traffic 
   congestion in India, Yulu provides the safest commute solution through a user-friendly mobile app to enable shared, solo and sustainable commuting.
   Yulu zones are located at all the appropriate locations (including metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, residential areas, corporate offices, etc) to make those first and 
   last miles smooth, affordable, and convenient!
   Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric 
   cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.
- **Libraries Used:** Python,Numpy,Matplotlib,seaborn,scipy.
- **Files:**
  - `EDA/Yulu : Hypothesis Testing/data`: Directory containing datasets.
  - `EDA/Yulu : Hypothesis Testing/src`: Collab notebooks.
